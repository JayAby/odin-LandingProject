                        I am Joel, and I like learning new programming languages which is exactly what I am doing right now.
                        Use The Odin Project, It is a good website for learning HTML and CSS, I have learnt a lot within the past few months 
                        that I have been using the website.

                Python is a very easy to learn programming language, it is the secocnd programming language I learnt. Python is a good programming language for beginners. It could be used to develop websites and softwares, it's also a good for data analysis and data visualization.</div>
                <div class="card"> <img src="./Images/JavaLogo.jpg" alt="Image contains a logo of Java">
                Java is a not so easy to learn programming language, I would say, but it is quite a fun and handy skill/programming languagae to learn.  Java could be used in the backend development of a website, it could also be used to develop games, develop mobile apps amongst many more.</div>
                <div class="card"> <img src="./Images/C_Programming.jpeg" alt="Image contains a logo of C programming">
                C is a procedural language, it is known for being efficient, portable and low-level access. In my opinion, C is a good handy skill to have. Some of the uses of the C programming lnaguage includes, system programming, embedded systems and general purpose applications - versatility. C has influenced many languages like C++, C# and even Java, amongst many more</div>
